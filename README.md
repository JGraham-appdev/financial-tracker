# Financial Tracker

This project was designed to show what I have learned about Java programming so far. With this application you can track all financial transactions for a business or for personal use.

My favorite function of this application is the ability to search for products by vendor. It is such an integral part of many apps that we all use. Without this function, apps like Amazon and YouTube would be way more difficult, maybe even impossible to use efficiently.

### Setup
In order to use my "Financial Tracker" efficiently, one needs to make sure dates and times are entered in the correct format (when prompted).

### Future Work
In the future, I would like to expand this project by giving it a proper website interface for other aspiring programmers to reference.

## Thank You!
Thank you to everyone who gave advice, shared resources, and offered motivation. You are all greatly appreciated.

Special thanks to Raymond Maroun for not only creating a skeleton of this project to help out his students, but for teaching me all I know about Java so far!
